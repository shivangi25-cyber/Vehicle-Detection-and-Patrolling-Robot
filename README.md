🧠 Vehicle Detection and Patrolling Robot

📍 Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, EasyOCR, Pandas
🔗 GitHub Repository

🚀 Overview

This project implements a real-time vehicle detection and license plate recognition system using advanced computer vision and deep learning models.
It detects vehicles from live video feeds or RTSP streams, identifies license plates, and logs all detections with timestamps for surveillance or analytics purposes.

⚙️ Features

🔍 Vehicle Detection: Detects cars, trucks, and bikes in real time using YOLOv8.

🧾 License Plate Recognition: Uses EasyOCR to extract and read vehicle number plates.

🕒 Data Logging: Automatically records detections (timestamp, vehicle type, license plate) in Excel format.

🖼️ Visual Display: Draws bounding boxes and annotations over live frames using OpenCV.

💾 Automated Processing: Runs continuously with customizable detection intervals.
